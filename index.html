        <h class='hd3'>An Evolution of Our Own</h>
        <p>I exist  today as more than myself, more than the ape body into which I was born. The sinews of my muscles and proteins of my brain, the genetic capabilities and inexplicable instincts I was born with fall far short of all that I can do.

We were born, nay <em>created</em>, by the guiding hand of evolution, or God, in the sub-Saharan African veld. Purpose built to roam the grasslands, to hunt, to climb in trees, to avoid being eaten, to simply survive in a harsh environment. The only gifts we were given were the ability to speak and the ability to form a few things with our hands. The only understanding we were given was that of a hunter; we have an innate and automatic knowledge of the kinematics which allow us to move about in the world, we have the analytical skills to understand the animals plants and environment immediately around us, both in space and in time.
        </p>
        <p>
So, then, it is striking how ill equipped we are to fling ourselves through space at 25,000 miles per hour toward the moon, to suss out the Big Bang, to manage billion-dollar multinational economies. Perhaps we are ill-suited for it. Think of the carelessness we show in our reckless spending which we seem incapable of realizing will lead to economic crisis until it is too late, or of our insistence on dumping ever more pollutants into our atmosphere, incapable of seeing the long term effects it will have.
        </p>
        <p>
But we are more than what we were created to be. We have outgrown our bodies, our brains, and even our minds. Unable to lift heavy things, we built levers, fork lifts, and jet engines. Unable to understand the universe and manage the complexity with which the world presents us, we developed mathematics to help us keep track of it all. That math would go beyond modeling what we already understood to show us new things that our stupid ape brains could never comprehend. We deal with theory of spacetime and the twenty one dimensions of quantum physics which our brains are flatly incapable of comprehending. Yet despite our inability to understand, we still come to know these things <em>through the tools we built</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
Similarly, our thought has been enhanced by language. I could not have come to have the self reflective thoughts which I write here were it not for my ability to distill the nebular whirlwind of thought within my brain into orderly language, which organizes my thoughts and allows me to apply precise logic to them. This is the feat which allowed thinkers like Aquinas and Locke to come to new revelations which they would not have been able to could they not saddle and direct their thoughts in such a way.
        </p>
        <p>
If you pay close attention, all but your most base emotional feelings are expressed through language. Take a moment and observe the monologue that's been running in your head all your life: that which you call consciousness: your stream of thoughts. I think you'll find that they're in English. This is why many young children are surprised to learn that foreigners think in another language; our language is so intrinsically tied to our most intimate thoughts that we cannot separate our true lowest-level selves from the slightly abstracted version of ourselves which exists as an English monologue of pure thought translated and organized into language. Orwell rightly observed that if language cannot express a thing then we are incapable of thinking it. We might <em>feel</em> it in the vaguest of ways, but we will feel lost by our inability to enunciate it, to organize it into something precise and meaningful. That vague feeling must be the greatest extent of thought which animals are capable of attaining. To say they do not think is inaccurate; they do - only they think on a level far below us because without language their thoughts take no discernible and palpable form as ours do. We are less intelligent than some whales, but our organization of mind, our language, the tool we have created for ourselves, allows us to surpass them in thought.
        </p>
        <p>
This brings us to the next hurtle, the startlingly limited and short thing that is human experience. Seventy short years and two poorly optimized eyes are vastly incomparable to all the wonders and problems which they strive to comprehend. Here comes our language again. We couldn't figure out the nature of the universe, or how to run an economy or a government, or the best way to live a human life, all in one lifetime. So we took the thoughts we had translated into words and transcribed them into pages. Then we pushed them off to the four corners of the Earth and all across time where they were read, turned back into, words, and contemplated as thought. In this way, we each became a node in a massive neural network. Each of us did a small part, and together a mass consciousness emerged, enabling us to act as an organization, a country, a species. Along came the internet and the process was catalyzed. We could do so much more and so much better through the mystery of emergence, the coming together of many.
        </p>
        <p>
And one day we found our human minds, as strengthened and interlinked as they were, simply didn't have the firepower to process the massive amounts of data which were required to properly predict the path of hurricanes or quickly determine the path of a ballistic projectile. So we expanded on our minds, building extensions to them outside of ourselves, metal minds which could compute that which we could not. These computers can perform operations which we never could. But now we can. Because we improved ourselves by augmenting our natural processing power with a processing power we had built. And so we make more intelligent decisions because we have once again improved ourselves by delegating tasks which our natural abilities cannot process to a device of our own invention, just like the language and writing and math and crowbars which came before.
        </p>
        <p>
But make no mistake, just because these computers are external to our physical bodies does not mean that they are external to ourselves. This is not the story of the exporting of human thought to the inhuman, but of the expanding of self to that which we have built. Just as we expanded our thought to language, we now expand it to computers. Computers are part of our minds because we have expanded what it is to be human. That which we create becomes part of us, strengthening us, allowing us to time and time again transcend the shackles of our current form.
        </p>
        <p>
One day soon the metal minds we build will become in every way more intelligent than the soft and mushy minds which God or Evolution bestowed upon us millions of years ago on that African veld. But that will not mean that we will lose our relevance as humans, but rather that we will be once again expanded. This mechanical thought will become our new mode of thought, and we will assimilate it into our minds, becoming more than what we were before.
        </p>
        <p>
Distant into the future, as science, technology, language, and thought progress and thereby beget more progression, we will ascend many more times. Each time we will be able to reach new heights which were never before available to us because each time we will go beyond our current capabilities, whatever they may be, by some invention which allows for better thought.
        </p>
        <p>
So when someone says that a thing is not knowable to humans, that we are too unintelligent or limited to comprehend it, or that a goal is unobtainable and not possible for our weak bodies or flimsy technology, remember that  the nature of humanity is that we have borrowed biology's greatest trick; we have learned how to evolve. Nothing will be impossible for us because with every new invention, that which is human will be elevated to engulf a new technology and overcome the limitations of what was once possible.</p>
